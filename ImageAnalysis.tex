\section{Image Analysis}
\noindent A key requirement for this project is to build a python script which will allow PNG images to be converted to data, which can then be manipulated and processed with python packages such as Sci-Kit Image (skimage) \cite{scikitimage}. Several microstructure images have been used in this project, from a variety of sources including previous research data, scientific literature and the provided database, all with full and sufficient permissions. Images were then pre-processed accordingly through various techniques such as segmentation, removal of noise and measurement, before being imported into FE simulations to be used to create a mesh.
