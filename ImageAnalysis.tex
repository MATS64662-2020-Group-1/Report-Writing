\section{Image Analysis}
\noindent A key requirement for this project is to build a python script which will allow PNG images to be converted to data, which can then be manipulated and processed with python packages such as Sci-Kit Image (skimage) \cite{scikitimage}. Several microstructure images have been used in this project, from a variety of sources including previous research data, scientific literature and the provided database, all with full and sufficient permissions. Images were then pre-processed accordingly through various techniques such as segmentation, removal of noise and measurement, before being imported into FE simulations to be used to create a mesh. This section will further detail how this process was undertaken and broken down through the use of test cases to ensure that the python scriprt and skimage were performing accurately and as desired.
