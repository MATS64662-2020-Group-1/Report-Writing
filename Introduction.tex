\section{Introduction}
Finite element modelling (FEM) is the process of segmenting a defined geometry by meshing, and solving coupled partial differential physics equations for individual elements within the built mesh, given inputs of boundary conditions surrounding the geometry, a series of timesteps over which the simulation runs, and materials parameters that describe how the geometry will behave under the specified conditions. The defined geometry may be a two dimensional image or a three dimensional object. For the purposes of this project, microstructural images have been used to estimate the physical behavior of a material on the microscopic scale. Image processing software based in python is used to prepare such images for conversion to a finite element modelling geometry input. There are a variety of different open-source finite element solvers and image processing software available for use in this task, including: sfepy, OOF2, DAMASK, sci-kit image and scipy.
