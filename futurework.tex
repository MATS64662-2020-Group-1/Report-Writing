\section{Future Work}
Further possible work could include:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Further optimization of code with the use of loops and combination of scripts.
  \item Improvement of general user interface with the workflow, combining image processing with meshing, processing, and post processing scripts.
  \item Functionality to create extrapolated 3D model simulations from extruded 2D images.
\end{itemize}
