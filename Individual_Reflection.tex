\section{Individual Reflection}

\noindent \textbf{Individual Contributions}:

\noindent \emph{Did you contribute? How?} \newline
Assigned to mesh and simulate the final processed images produced withion the image-processing repository. Helped finalize binarization of images to prepare them for finite element analysis, and wrote script to save images as csv files, in an attempt to join the efforts of the image processing and FEM sub-teams. Also assisted with test case 5 of FEM analysis of a full size microstructural image.

\noindent \textbf{Group Work}:

\noindent \emph{Did you work well together? Did you facilitate including everyone in making contributions? Did you communicate well with each other?} \newline
I believe group 1 worked efficiently and was well-managed. Set backs with understanding meshing and simulation of the pre-processed images due to quarantine affected the overall ouput of the project. However the group communicated well with scheduled meetings per week, and assigned tasks were carried out sufficiently.

\noindent \textbf{Final Outcome}:

\noindent \emph{Are you proud of the end result? Why or why not? What could have been improved in your project} \newline
The end result needs improvement, but does achieve the main aim of the project. The project may have been improved with more meeting sessions guiding each other through the use of specific programs such as scipy/sfepy and gmsh, as none of the team had prior expeirience with these particular software packages.
