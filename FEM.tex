\section{Finite Element Modelling}
The FEM simulations were run using the Object Oriented Finite (OOF) element analysis project called OOF2, created by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (available here: \url{https://www.ctcms.nist.gov/oof/oof2/}) \cite{OOF2Modelling}. Four test cases were trialed to ensure the simulation was generating results as expected, the simplest case is heat diffusion through a simple shape and the most complex incorporating heat diffusion and displacement in a single grain of Ti-6Al-4V. Once the test cases proved successful, the FEM simulation was run for a larger section of Ti-6Al-4V and the heat diffusion and displacement were determined.
